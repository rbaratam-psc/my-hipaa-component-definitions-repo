# req-9.1.2 - \[REPLACE_ME\] 9.1.2 Implement Physical And/Or Logical Controls To Restrict Access To Publicly Accessible Network Jacks.

## Control Statement

For example, network jacks located in public areas and areas accessible to visitors could be disabled and only enabled when network access is explicitly authorized. Alternatively, processes could be implemented to ensure that visitors are escorted at all times in areas with active network jacks.
