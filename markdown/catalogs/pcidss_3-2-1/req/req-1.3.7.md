# req-1.3.7 - \[REPLACE_ME\] 1.3.7 Do Not Disclose Private Ip Addresses And Routing Information To Unauthorized Parties.

## Control Statement

Note: Methods to obscure IP addressing may include, but are not limited to:
* Network Address Translation (NAT)
* Placing servers containing cardholder data behind proxy servers/firewalls,
* Removal or filtering of route advertisements for private networks that
employ registered addressing,
* Internal use of RFC1918 address space instead of registered addresses.
