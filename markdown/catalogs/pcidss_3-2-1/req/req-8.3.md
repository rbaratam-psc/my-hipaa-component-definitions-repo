# req-8.3 - \[REPLACE_ME\] 8.3 Incorporate Two-Factor Authentication For Remote Network Access Originating From Outside The Network By Personnel (Including Users And Administrators) And All Third Parties, (Including Vendor Access For Support Or Maintenance). Note: Two-Factor Authentication Requires That Two Of The Three Authentication Methods (See Requirement 8.2 For Descriptions Of Authentication Methods) Be Used For Authentication. Using One Factor Twice (For Example, Using Two Separate Passwords) Is Not Considered Two-Factor Authentication.

## Control Statement

Examples of two-factor technologies include remote authentication and dial-in service (RADIUS) with tokens; terminal access controller access control system (TACACS) with tokens; and other technologies that facilitate two-factor authentication.
