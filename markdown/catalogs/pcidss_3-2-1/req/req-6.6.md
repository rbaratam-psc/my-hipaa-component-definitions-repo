# req-6.6 - \[REPLACE_ME\] 6.6 For Public-Facing Web Applications, Address New Threats And Vulnerabilities On An Ongoing Basis And Ensure These Applications Are Protected Against Known Attacks By Either Of The Following Methods:

## Control Statement

* Reviewing public-facing web applications via manual or automated
application vulnerability security assessment tools or methods, at least annually
and after any changes

Note: This assessment is not the same as the vulnerability
scans performed for Requirement 11.2.

* Installing an automated technical solution that detects and prevents
web-based attacks (for example, a web- application firewall) in
front of public- facing web applications, to continually check all traffic.
