# req-6.3.2 - \[REPLACE_ME\] 6.3.2 Review Custom Code Prior To Release To Production Or Customers In Order To Identify Any Potential Coding Vulnerability (Using Either Manual Or Automated Processes) To Include At Least The Following:

## Control Statement

* Code changes are reviewed by individuals other than the originating
code author, and by individuals knowledgeable about code-review techniques and
secure coding practices.
* Code reviews ensure code is developed according
to secure coding guidelines
* Appropriate corrections are implemented
prior to release.
* Code-review results are reviewed and approved by management prior to release.

Note: This requirement for code reviews applies to all custom code
(both internal and public-facing), as part of the system development life cycle.

Code reviews can be conducted by knowledgeable internal personnel or third parties.
Public-facing web applications are also subject to additional controls,
to address ongoing threats and vulnerabilities after implementation,
as defined at PCI DSS Requirement 6.6.
