# req-2.3 - \[REPLACE_ME\] 2.3 Encrypt All Non-Console Administrative Access Using Strong Cryptography. Use Technologies Such As Ssh, Vpn, Or Tls For Web-Based Management And Other Non-Console Administrative Access.

## Control Statement

Note: SSL and early TLS are not considered strong cryptography and cannot be used as a security control after June 30, 2016. Prior to this date, existing implementations that use SSL and/or early TLS must have a formal Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan in place.
Effective immediately, new implementations must not use SSL or early TLS.
POS POI terminals (and the SSL/TLS termination points to which they connect) that can be verified as not being susceptible to any known exploits for SSL and early TLS may continue using these as a security control after June 30, 2016.
