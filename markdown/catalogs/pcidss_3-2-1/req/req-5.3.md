# req-5.3 - \[REPLACE_ME\] 5.3 Ensure That Anti-Virus Mechanisms Are Actively Running And Cannot Be Disabled Or Altered By Users, Unless Specifically Authorized By Management On A Case-By-Case Basis For A Limited Time Period.

## Control Statement

Note: Anti-virus solutions may be temporarily disabled only if there is legitimate technical need, as authorized by management on a case-by-case basis. If anti-virus protection needs to be disabled for a specific purpose, it must be formally authorized. Additional security measures may also need to be implemented for the period of time during which anti-virus protection is not active.
