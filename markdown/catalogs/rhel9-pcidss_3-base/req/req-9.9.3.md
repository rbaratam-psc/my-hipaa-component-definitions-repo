Training should include the following: * Verify the identity of any third-party persons claiming to be repair

or troubleshoot devices.
* Do not install, replace, or return devices without verification. * Be aware of suspicious behavior around devices (for example, attempts
by unknown persons to unplug or open devices).
* Report suspicious behavior and indications of device tampering or
substitution to appropriate personnel (for example, to a manager or
security officer).
