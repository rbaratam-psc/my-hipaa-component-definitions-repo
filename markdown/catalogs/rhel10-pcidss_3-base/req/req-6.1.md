# req-6.1 - \[REPLACE_ME\] 6.1 Establish A Process To Identify Security Vulnerabilities, Using Reputable Outside Sources For Security Vulnerability Information, And Assign A Risk Ranking (For Example, As 'High', 'Medium', Or 'Low') To Newly Discovered Security Vulnerabilities.

## Control Statement

Note: Risk rankings should be based on industry best practices as well as
consideration of potential impact. For example, criteria for ranking
vulnerabilities may include consideration of the CVSS base score,
and/or the classification by the vendor, and/or type of systems affected.

Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings
will vary based on an organization's environment and risk- assessment strategy.
Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered
to be a 'high risk' to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking,
vulnerabilities may be considered 'critical' if they pose an imminent
threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a
potential compromise if not addressed. Examples of critical systems may include
security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems
that store, process, or transmit cardholder data.

<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
