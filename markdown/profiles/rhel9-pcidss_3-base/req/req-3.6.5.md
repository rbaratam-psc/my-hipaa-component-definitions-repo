# req-3.6.5 - \[REPLACE_ME\] 3.6.5 Retirement Or Replacement (For Example, Archiving, Destruction, And/Or Revocation) Of Keys As Deemed Necessary When The Integrity Of The Key Has Been Weakened (For Example, Departure Of An Employee With Knowledge Of A Clear-Text Key Component), Or Keys Are Suspected Of Being Compromised.

## Control Statement

Note: If retired or replaced cryptographic keys need to be retained, these keys must be securely archived (for example, by using a key-encryption key). Archived cryptographic keys should only be used for decryption/verification purposes.
