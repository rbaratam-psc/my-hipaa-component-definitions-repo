## Control Statement

Note: This requirement is a best practice until June 30, 2015, after which it becomes a requirement.
Note: The exact wording of an acknowledgement will depend on the agreement between the two parties, the details of the service being provided, and the responsibilities assigned to each party. The acknowledgement does not have to include the exact wording provided in this requirement.
