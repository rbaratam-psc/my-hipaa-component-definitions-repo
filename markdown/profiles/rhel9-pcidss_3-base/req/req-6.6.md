# req-6.6 - \[REPLACE_ME\] 6.6 For Public-Facing Web Applications, Address New Threats And Vulnerabilities On An Ongoing Basis And Ensure These Applications Are Protected Against Known Attacks By Either Of The Following Methods:

## Control Statement

* Reviewing public-facing web applications via manual or automated
  application vulnerability security assessment tools or methods, at least annually
  and after any changes

  Note: This assessment is not the same as the vulnerability
  scans performed for Requirement 11.2.

* Installing an automated technical solution that detects and prevents
  web-based attacks (for example, a web- application firewall) in
  front of public- facing web applications, to continually check all traffic.

<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://oscal-compass.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
